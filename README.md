# student-record-managment
 A simple C-based Student Management System using file handling and role-based access. Users log in as Admin, Staff, User, or Guest, each with different permissions. Student data is stored in coding_skills.txt, allowing adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting records depending on the role.
